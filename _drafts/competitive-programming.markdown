# Competitive programming


# Plan

- At least 1 exercise per day
- Use: hackerrank, leetcode, topcoder
- Take part in challenges & contests
- Take notes on structure & checklist & tips & tricks
- How that progress changes me as a programmer. What's the benefit, are my thinking schemes change? In what way?
- Types of errors I did


# Data gathering

1. Setup timer
2. Track reading time
3. Track submissions, total duration
4. Retrospective
    - What I did well?
    - What I did wrong?

# Analysis

## Types of errors

1. Indices
    - exclusive/inclusive
    - forgot about the last iteration
    - diff error
2. Missed a necessary piece of information from the description
3. Corner cases
4. Optimization/timeouts 


Count of types of errors I did:
1. Indices: 1
2. Optimization: 1


## Retrospective

**_Game of codes_ contest (2018-11-16)**

What I did wrong:
- After 2h I got a little irritated 
- I didn't go through tips & tricks I had written from the beginning
- I didn't prepare boilerplate code (like stdin parsing, etc.)
- Too many distractions: phone, notifications
- No water, proper eating, sedentary day (no exercises)
- Not enough sleep
- Straying away to other tasks I've to do today
- I didn't write the potential solutions I've already went through (I've kept them in my mind only)
- Didn't use structured approach based on facts & elimination
- Didn't state brute force explicity
- I didn't look at other challenges (maybe some would be faster to complete)
- My goal was to correctly implement every challenge and not maximizing the total contest points
- Didn't prepare workspace (mental & physical well-being, distractions, sleep, water, etc.)
- Didn't warm-up on the other challenges 

What I did well:
- Forced myself to sit until completed
- Forced myself to overcome irritation and focus on the task at hand
- I wrote examples and went through them thouroughly
- Didn't submit until certain of the result
- Retest on examples when finished
- At some point I shut down every notification

How should I improve next time:
- Get a good night sleep & exercise
- Eat well & prepare water
- Warm up on several challenges
- Prepare structured approach checklist along with tips & trics
- Prepare boilerplate code (stdin parsing, cheat-sheet with common patterns)
- Skim through challenges and optimize for points

## How this challenge influence me as a software engineer

- 2018-11-14 - started
- 2018-11-26 - Idea of starting from the end result can be useful for personal goal setting/achieving results & identifying dependencies/requirements
