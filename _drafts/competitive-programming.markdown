# Competitive programming


# Plan

- At least 1 exercise per day
- Use: hackerrank, leetcode, topcoder
- Take part in challenges & contests
- Take notes on structure & checklist & tips & tricks
- How that progress changes me as a programmer. What's the benefit, are my thinking schemes change? In what way?
- Types of errors I did


# Data gathering

1. Setup timer
2. Track reading time
3. Track submissions, total duration
4. Retrospective
    - What I did well?
    - What I did wrong?

# Analysis
