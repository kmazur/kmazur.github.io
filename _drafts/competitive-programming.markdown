# Competitive programming


# Plan

- At least 1 exercise per day
- Use: hackerrank, leetcode, topcoder
- Take part in challenges & contests
- Take notes on structure & checklist & tips & tricks
- How that progress changes me as a programmer. What's the benefit, are my thinking schemes change? In what way?
- Types of errors I did


# Structured approach

1. **Constraints & IO**
2. **Examples & Tests**
3. **Sketch design & Complexity (space & time)**
    - **Brute force**
    - **Optimize** (unnecessary code, duplicates, memoization)
4. **Code**
    - **Modularize**
5. **Verification**



## Tips & Tricks

TODO: structure it

- Two pointers run
- Use Map/Set
- Sort & then work with it
- Use graphs: DFS/BFS
- For intervals: sort by start (end), iterate over start
- For recursive algorithm: use memo (and cut the list/size from start)
- Start with reversed approach: what is the goal and what is a required one step before?  







# Analysis

## Types of errors

1. Indices
    - exclusive/inclusive
    - forgot about the last iteration
    - diff error
2. Missed a necessary piece of information from the description
3. Corner cases
4.
